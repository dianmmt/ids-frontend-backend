# Performance Monitoring Improvements Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **More Accurate Performance Calculations**
- **CPU Usage**: Now uses platform-specific methods (PowerShell on Windows, /proc/stat on Linux)
- **Memory Usage**: Accounts for cached memory and buffers, not just free memory
- **Disk Usage**: Cross-platform filesystem monitoring with accurate space calculation
- **Network Load**: Real network interface statistics instead of simulated data

### 2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- **Windows**: PowerShell integration for accurate system metrics
- **Linux/Unix**: /proc filesystem and system commands
- **macOS**: Unix-based calculations
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Multiple levels of fallback for reliability

### 3. **Refresh Functionality**
- **Manual Refresh**: Button to update performance data immediately
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **Real-time Display**: Live performance metrics with timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if API fails

## Test Results

### Before vs After
- **CPU Usage**: More accurate real-time calculation (29.85% → 37.63%)
- **Memory Usage**: Includes cached memory (80.00% → 79.64%)
- **Disk Usage**: Accurate cross-platform calculation (93.46%)
- **Network Load**: Real network statistics (0%)

### Refresh Functionality
- ✅ Manual refresh working
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Database storage of metrics
- ✅ Alert system for critical conditions

## API Endpoints Added

```bash
POST /api/performance/refresh    # Manual refresh
GET /api/performance/realtime    # Real-time data
GET /api/performance/system-info # System information
```

## Usage

1. **Manual Refresh**: Click the refresh button in the Performance Monitor
2. **Auto-refresh**: Happens automatically every 30 seconds
3. **Real-time Data**: Always shows current system performance
4. **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker

The performance monitoring is now much more accurate and works reliably across different platforms!
